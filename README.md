An attempt to write an expressive musical instrument for mobile devices using the web audio api.

Currently plays back a single pentatonic scale note as a sawtooth wave with a fixed amplitude envelope on touch. i.e. 'isn't expressive.'

Currently no dependencies. Just clone, start a local server in the file, and you're good to go!
